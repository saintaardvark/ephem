* TODO Break out config to separate file or *something*.
* TODO Localtime works if you select UTC; if you select localtime, adds 8 hours and goes from there.
** Test case #1 (now working)
    - click now
    - select UTC
    - Submit
    - Says:
      - For time: 2013-02-19 00:43 Local
      - 2013-02-19 00:43 UTC
      - The UTC is correct; the local time is not.  This is going by
        pos in Stellarium; the pos is correct for now/00:43 UTC, it's
        just the local time that needs to be corrected.
  - So:
    - Localtime is datetime(*getLocalDateTime(home.date.tuple())[:6]).strftime("%F %R")
    - UTC is:				      home.date.datetime().strftime("%F %R")
  - So what's wrong with getLocalDateTIme?
    - tz is getting set correctly.
    - Aha -- pytz.utc.normalize?
      - Yes: that appears to set the time to utc.  If I unset that,
        seems to work: for Test Case #1 described above, time displayed
        is local; UTC is sane; positions make sense.
  - But now another problem.
** Test Case #2 (where the bug is now)
    - Click now
    - select Local, ensure Canada/Pacific checked
    - Submit
    - Error
      - Line 842: astimezone() cannot be applied to a naive datetime
      - That line:
      - Line 842: astimezone() cannot be applied to a naive datetime
        return utc.localize(datetime(*date).astimezone(tz)).timetuple()
      - That's in getLocaldateTime too...
  - Not sure what that means.  Tried adding:
    ,----
    |except ValueError:
    |    return utc.normalize(utc.localize(datetime(*date[:5])).astimezone(tz)).timetuple()
    `----
  - but no good; another error...wait, no: wrong times.  I was sure I
    got an error before...
    - Wrong times:  click now, Local timezone.
    - For time:
      - 2013-02-19 01:15 Local
      - 2013-02-19 09:15 UTC
      - ..which is just very, very bogus.
    - But the positions for the time apear to be correct -- judging by
      the moon, anyhow.
      - So it looks like it's just guessing the wrong time: adding 8
        hours to get local time, then adding 8 hours to *that* to get
        UTC.  Positions are correct, just wrong guess.
      - Leaving this for now.
